## Server Documentation & More
Providing a short description is never an easy task, however it's definitely required in this case. This repository is dedicate solely to the minecraft server, which currently goes unnamed, in that it purposes as a way to provide information to players. Information such as resource pack updates and links, server/world updates, general information, and more.

#### Wiki & Documentation
Information regarding gameplay on the server using the link http://wiki.syszee.me/ . Whether it be commands, ranking information, rules, warps, etc - all useful information can be found there. If you have any questions **DO NOT** ask them in-game, you will simply be directed to the wiki. If you're 100% certain that you've already read through the wiki and just cannot find an answer, ask a helper in game. 

#### Resource Pack
You can find the resource pack using the link http://rp.syszee.me/ . Once the server goes live, the pack will automatically download on your client, provided you have that feature enabled. 

#### More Information
As for this README file coming to a close, it is recommended that you do check the wiki, as all information can be found there, rather than just this general brief. It is also recommend that you use the following commands in-game to answer a few general questions.

```
/rules - Provides a general set of rules to follow within the community.
/help - Provides a list of ALL commands you, individually, are able to use.
/motd - Shows the general message of the day information, surprisingly not a daily thing.
/motd more - Provides additional information on the state of the server.
```
